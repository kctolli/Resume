Currently I am working as a Software Developer at Younique Products.
At Younique, I focus on Backend Development, with tools such as Node JS, Express JS, AWS, Dynamodb, Docker, NPM, JQuery and the DERN Stack.
I recieved my Bachelor’s (BS) from BYU-Idaho in Software Engineering, and minors in Computer Engineering and Data Science. 
I love to learn new things and solve problems.
